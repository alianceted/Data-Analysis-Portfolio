# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio, where I showcase a range of analytical projects demonstrating my expertise in data manipulation, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models. These projects reflect my passion for uncovering insights and driving business value using data.

## Featured Projects
### 1. Customer Segmentation for Online Retail Business using Pyhton
In this project, I performed customer segmentation for an eCommerce company using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) analysis. The goal was to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, allowing the business to create tailored marketing strategies, optimize product recommendations, and improve retention efforts.

### 2. Layoffs Data Analysis (2020-2023) using MySQL
This project involved cleaning and analyzing a global dataset of company layoffs from 2020 to 2023. The dataset covered industries, company stages, and layoff percentages across 1,600+ distinct companies worldwide. My analysis aimed to uncover trends in layoffs by geography, industry, and company stage.
