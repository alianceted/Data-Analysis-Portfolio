# Customer Segmentation for Online Retail Business

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation for an online retail business using transaction data. Customer segmentation is a crucial element of marketing strategy, enabling businesses to group customers based on shared characteristics, such as purchasing behavior, preferences, and demographics. With these insights, companies can tailor their marketing efforts, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize revenue generation. The goal of this analysis is to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing patterns and to leverage these segments for personalized marketing campaigns, product recommendations, and retention strategies.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to improve the business performance of an online retail company by better understanding customer behavior. By segmenting customers into different groups, the company can:
- Create targeted marketing campaigns
- Offer personalized product recommendations
- Optimize pricing strategies
- Identify high-value customers for retention
- Enhance inventory management by understanding demand trends

## Data and Preprocessing
The dataset used includes transaction records such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Quantity, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country. Data cleaning was performed to:
- Remove records with missing CustomerID
- Fix negative Quantity and UnitPrice
- Standardize the column names
- Handle missing values and discrepancies in StockCode and Description

## Methodology
The segmentation was done using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value) model, which assigns each customer three key attributes:
- **Recency** – The number of days since the customer's last purchase.
- **Frequency** – The total number of purchases by the customer.
- **Monetary Value** – The total revenue generated by the customer.
The RFM values were calculated, scaled, and fed into clustering algorithms for customer segmentation.

## Clustering Techniques
Four clustering algorithms were applied to the RFM data:
- **K-means Clustering:** Produced distinct customer groups, evaluated using Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz scores.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Created a dendrogram-like structure for deeper insights into customer relationships.
- **Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM):** Probabilistic clustering that identified customer groups with overlapping characteristics.
- **DBSCAN:** Density-based clustering used to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes and detect noise (outliers).

## Key Insights
**K-means** and **GMM** provided well-separated clusters, suitable for interpretability and actionability.
**Hierarchical Clustering** showed the relationships between customers at various levels of granularity, helping to explore different cluster sizes.
**DBSCAN** was useful for identifying outliers, helping the business to focus on core customer groups.
Each method was evaluated using metrics like the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index, helping to select the best performing model for segmentation.

## Conclusion
The customer segments identified can guide the company in designing personalized marketing strategies and retention efforts. The model also allows for detecting outliers and improving operational efficiency in inventory management and demand forecasting.
